# SMS Spam Classifier

A machine learning application that uses Naive Bayes classification to detect spam messages in SMS texts. Built with Streamlit, this interactive web application provides a user-friendly interface for spam detection and model performance analysis.

## Features

- üéØ Real-time spam detection for SMS messages
- üìä Interactive model performance metrics
- üìà Visualization of classification results
- üîç Analysis of key words contributing to classification
- üì± User-friendly web interface

## Technical Details

### Model Architecture
- **Algorithm**: Naive Bayes (MultinomialNB)
  - A probabilistic classifier based on Bayes' theorem
  - Makes the "naive" assumption of feature independence
  - Particularly effective for text classification tasks
- **Feature Extraction**: TF-IDF Vectorization
- **Training Data**: SMS Spam Collection Dataset
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score

### Tech Stack
- Python 3.12
- Streamlit (Web Interface)
- scikit-learn (Machine Learning)
- pandas (Data Processing)
- matplotlib (Visualization)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Ayush-Bitla/SMS-Spam-Classifier.git
cd SMS-Spam-Classifier
```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
```bash
python -m venv venv
# On Windows
.\venv\Scripts\activate
# On Unix or MacOS
source venv/bin/activate
```

3. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Train the model:
The model files are not included in the repository due to size constraints. When you run the application for the first time, it will automatically:
- Load the SMS Spam Collection dataset
- Preprocess the text data
- Train the Naive Bayes classifier
- Generate the necessary model files

## Usage

1. Start the Streamlit app:
```bash
streamlit run script/streamlit_app.py
```

2. Open your web browser and navigate to:
```
http://localhost:8501
```

3. Use the application:
   - Enter a message in the text area
   - Click "Classify Message" to get the prediction
   - View model performance metrics and visualizations

## Dataset

The project uses the SMS Spam Collection Dataset, which contains:
- 5,574 SMS messages
- Labeled as 'ham' (legitimate) or 'spam'
- Used for training and evaluating the classifier

## Model Files

The following model files are generated when you run the application:
- `vectorizer.pkl`: TF-IDF vectorizer for text preprocessing
- `model.pkl`: Trained Naive Bayes classifier

These files are automatically saved in the `script/` directory and are gitignored to keep the repository size manageable.
