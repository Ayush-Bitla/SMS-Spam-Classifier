## Features

- 🎯 Real-time spam detection for SMS messages
- 📊 Interactive model performance metrics
- 📈 Visualization of classification results
- 🔍 Analysis of key words contributing to classification
- 📱 User-friendly web interface

## Technical Details

### Model Architecture
- **Algorithm**: Naive Bayes (MultinomialNB)
  - A probabilistic classifier based on Bayes' theorem
  - Makes the "naive" assumption of feature independence
  - Particularly effective for text classification tasks
- **Feature Extraction**: TF-IDF Vectorization
- **Training Data**: SMS Spam Collection Dataset
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score

### Tech Stack
- Python 3.12
- Streamlit (Web Interface)
- scikit-learn (Machine Learning)
- pandas (Data Processing)
- matplotlib (Visualization)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Ayush-Bitla/SMS-Spam-Classifier.git
cd SMS-Spam-Classifier
```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
```bash
python -m venv venv
# On Windows
.\venv\Scripts\activate
# On Unix or MacOS
source venv/bin/activate
```

3. Install dependencies:

## Dataset

The project uses the SMS Spam Collection Dataset, which contains:
- 5,574 SMS messages
- Labeled as 'ham' (legitimate) or 'spam'
- Used for training and evaluating the classifier
